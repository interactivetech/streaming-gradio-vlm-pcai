# Real-Time VLM-Powered Video Stream Analysis on HPE Private Cloud AI

author: andrew.mendez@hpe.com


This project demonstrates a powerful, interactive web application for analyzing multiple, real-time video streams using a Vision Language Model (VLM). The application is built with Gradio, containerized with Docker, and designed for seamless deployment on **HPE Private Cloud AI (PCAI)** using a reusable Helm chart.

Users can view up to four MJPEG video streams, capture a single frame from any stream, and send it to a deployed VLM with a custom prompt to extract structured information.

### Key Features

*   **Quad-Stream Viewer:** Monitor up to four independent MJPEG video streams simultaneously in a tabbed interface.
*   **On-Demand VLM Analysis:** Capture a single frame from any live stream and send it to a Vision Language Model for analysis.
*   **Structured Data Extraction:** The VLM prompt is engineered to return structured data (e.g., vehicle type, color, status), which the application parses into a clean JSON object.
*   **Dynamic VLM Configuration:** Configure the VLM's API endpoint and key directly within the Gradio UI, allowing for easy switching between different models or environments.
*   **Data Export:** Download the parsed JSON data for any analysis with a single click.
*   **HPE PCAI Optimized:** Packaged as a Helm chart that integrates with PCAI's Istio gateway and "Tools & Frameworks" deployment model.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Model Deployment in HPE PCAI

This application requires a Vision Language Model to be deployed and running within the HPE Machine Learning Inference Software Tool. The prompt is specifically tailored for:

*   **Model:** `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct`
*   **Details:** [Hugging Face Model Card](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct)

Before deploying this application, you must:
1.  Deploy the `Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct` model in your HPE PCAI environment.
2.  Obtain the **API Base URL** (the model's inference endpoint).
3.  Generate and copy an **API Key** for accessing the model.

You will need the API Base URL and API Key to configure the application after it is deployed.

### 2. Local Development Tools

*   **Docker:** To build and push the application container image.
*   **Helm 3.x:** To package the Kubernetes deployment chart.
*   **`kubectl`:** (Optional) For inspecting the deployment in your Kubernetes cluster.

## Quickstart: Build and Deploy

The process involves three main steps: building the Docker image, packaging the Helm chart, and deploying it through the HPE PCAI user interface.

### Step 1: Build and Push the Docker Image

The application code is packaged into a Docker image which will be pulled by your Kubernetes cluster.

1.  Navigate to the `docker` directory:
    ```bash
    cd docker/
    ```

2.  Ensure you are logged into a Docker registry that your PCAI cluster can access (e.g., Docker Hub, a private registry).
    ```bash
    docker login
    ```

3.  Execute the build script. This will build the image for the `linux/amd64` platform and push it to the registry. The default image name is `mendeza/gradio_stream_demo:0.0.1`.
    ```bash
    bash build.sh
    ```

### Step 2: Package the Helm Chart

The Helm chart contains all the Kubernetes manifests needed to run the application on PCAI.

1.  Navigate to the `helm` directory:
    ```bash
    cd helm/
    ```

2.  Package the chart into a `.tgz` archive.
    ```bash
    helm package .
    ```

3.  This command will create a file named `gradio-vlm-chart-0.1.0.tgz`. This is the file you will upload to PCAI.

### Step 3: Deploy via HPE Private Cloud AI

1.  Log in to your **HPE Private Cloud AI** console.
2.  Navigate to **Tools & Frameworks** from the side menu.
3.  Click **Import Framework**.

    *   **Step 1: Framework Details**
        *   **Framework Name:** `Gradio VLM Stream Analyzer`
        *   **Description:** `An interactive UI to analyze frames from MJPEG streams with a Vision Language Model.`
        *   Optionally, upload a logo.
        *   Click **Next**.

    *   **Step 2: Upload Package**
        *   Upload the `gradio-vlm-chart-0.1.0.tgz` file you created in the previous step.
        *   Choose a **Namespace** to deploy into (e.g., your project's namespace).
        *   Click **Next**.

    *   **Step 3: Review & Deploy**
        *   The UI will display the contents of the `values.yaml` file.
        *   > **IMPORTANT:** You must configure the ingress endpoint. Locate the `ezua.virtualService.endpoint` key and update its value to match your PCAI environment's domain. For example:
        *   ```yaml
          # Change this:
          endpoint: "gradio-vlm.${DOMAIN_NAME}"
          
          # To something like this:
          endpoint: "gradio-vlm.my-namespace.ingress.pcai-cluster.mycompany.com"
          ```
        *   Review other values if needed (e.g., `replicaCount`, `resources`).
        *   Click **Deploy**.

## Using the Application

1.  Once the deployment is complete, navigate to **My Workloads** in PCAI to find and launch the application.
2.  The application will open in a new tab.

### Initial Configuration

Before you can analyze frames, you must configure the VLM endpoint:

1.  Expand the **Vision Model Configuration** accordion at the top.
2.  Enter the **API Key** and **API Base URL** that you obtained from your model deployment in the prerequisites.
3.  Click **Apply Configuration**. A status message will confirm if the connection was successful.

### Analyzing a Stream

1.  Select one of the **Stream** tabs.
2.  Enter an MJPEG stream URL and click **Start Stream**.
3.  Once the video is playing, you can click **Analyze Current Frame**.
4.  The application will capture the latest frame, send it to the VLM, and display the raw text output and the parsed JSON object below.
5.  Click **Save Parsed JSON** to download the results.
